IMMERSIVE NAMES MOD - VERSION 1.4: ETHNIC MINORITIES

IMMERSIVE NAMES replaces character names in XCOM2 with namelists that are considerably more robust, accurate, and proportionate than the ones that ship with the game. This mod expands every default character namelist in the game from a few dozen to a few hundred or thousand. Common first and last names also appear in rough proportion to their popularity. Every country in the base game now has researched namelists that should fairly reflect the names found in those countries today.

VERSION 1.4: ETHNIC MINORITIES re-weights the ethnic composition for every country in the game to fairly represent ethnic minorities, and uses ethnically appropriate names for each ethnic group where possible.  For example, 3% of German characters will now have Turkish names and brown complexions. For each country I tried to represent every culture group that constitutes more than 0.5% of the country's population. 

This mod includes over 116,000 new name listings per language pack, and there are 11 language packs besides English, so it's rather large as far as text mods go. Rest assured your game won't run any slower in any case - character creation might take a split-second longer than usual, but that's it.

If you're a modder and you've created a mod that conflicts with mine, feel free to release a version that combines our mods. Or reach out to me if you don't have time; if I like your mod I could be open to the idea of doing it myself. Reach out to me on the Nexus, or in the Steam Workshop comment section of the mod; just be advised that I don't hang out in these places all the time and may not get back to you promptly.
